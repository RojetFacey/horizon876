        <h2><font color="green">Twelve Pillar</font><br>
            (Chapter 4-7 Summary)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Twelve pillars’ chapters 4-7 depicts a father son relationship between Charlie and Michael. Their bond grew 
            slowly as they would meet up to discuss Mr. Davis's Pillars of Success. At each meeting Charlie's would teach 
            Michael a few meaningful life lessons that can heavily change his life tremendously. Charlie has a good heart 
            and tries his best to encourage Michael to be cautious of the paths he chooses to follow, manage his time 
            better and not become a slave to the urgent, but be mindful of the relationships you keep with your peers, and 
            last but not least become a lifelong learner.

            <br><br>
            The lessons thought throughout the chapters have challenge me to actually give my future goals some more thought. 
            Design a plan that better maps out the path I would like to take, to achieve the goals I have set to accomplish. 
            Also, to work on my time management skills in order to not become a slave to the urgent, because truth be told I 
            procrastinate a lot. To analyse and categorize my relationships accordingly to avoid the cons of bad influences. 
            Most of all be mindful of the three important mainstays mentioned which are: reading books, observing, and 
            learning from a successful person and to constantly reflect on one’s own experience learning what went right from 
            wrong. Because formal education makes a living, but self-education makes a fortune.
